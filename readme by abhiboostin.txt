so what we gonna do is simple
we open the anaconda prompt  
and then use these command copy paste or just learn dude
 -   conda activate abhiboostin   
 - cd C:\Users\asus\OneDrive\Desktop\anomaly\your_project
 -   python app.py 


now when taking input fo to the your project and then data and then input you can take input
also i modified the code a bit so that you don't have to worry about the output delete you can take 
multiple input sequentially one after another without deleting the output file.
